    "Earth Observations data has been identified by the UN among the alternative big data sources that is instrumental to the the modernization of national statistical systems, for the production of official statistics and reporting to the SDG. In particular. In particular, EO data can be used to produce crop type maps that are accurate, timely and granular, allowing for the calculation of crop acreage, and crop yield when coupled with crop growth models. In addition to crop type maps, the delineation of crop field boundaries . \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the of EO data into national operational contexts is still low due to the technical and administrative barriers that are still found. As a result crop type maps, crop yield maps and crop boundary maps are rare to find in countries, and when available they are not regularly kept up-to-date. \n",
    "\n",
    "To increase the uptake of EO data for official statistics in countries, FAO has launched the EOSTAT project in 2019 with the scope of developing a novel, simplified and standardized EO approach and to use it to build technical capacity in countries through the implementation of pilot projects. EOSTAT outputs are typically national land cover maps, crop masks, crop type maps, crop yield maps and crop field boundary maps, which in turn feed into the FAO Hand in Hand Initiative. Mozambique is a beneficiary of the EOSTAT project and is participating to the HiH initiative. \n",

    "To amplify the outreach of the EOSTAT project,  FAO has established a collaboration with Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) and with Frontier SI who will is the implementing partner in Rwanda and Mozambique.   \n"
